# React Express JWT

A boilerplate for fullstack projects written in TypeScript, React, Express and MongoDb.

## Install project

ename the file `template.env` to `.env`, and replace the values with your email, password, etc. Do the same thing in the `client` folder.

Then run `npm install` at the root of the project. Since we're using [Concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) this will install packages for backend and frontend.

## Run project

Run `npm run dev` at the root of the project. Once again, thanks to Concurrently, backend and frontend will run at the same time.

## Packages

## Backend

### API

All the functions can be found in the `routes` folder.

### Models

All the models can be found in `models` folder.

### Create data

Find an example for adding bulk data inside a database in `db/seed.js`.

## Frontend

### API

For backend calls, use the folder `client/src/api`, and follow the same pattern. You can see an example on the page `client/src/pages/auth/Login.js`.

### Add pages

Create your pages in `client/src/pages`. Then, go to `client/src/routes/routes.js` and add them in the array `const routes`.

### Styling

Most of components come from `TSX library` package. If you need new components, you can add them in `client/src/components`.
